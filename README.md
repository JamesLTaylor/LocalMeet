# East Herts Local Meet

LocalMeet is a human first community building site. Helping people meet each other, spend time doing what they enjoy and flourishing as human beings.

It is only for the East Herts area and exists only to support that area. It will never expand and never try to become a business. People are free to make something similar for their own local areas.

Event organizers can charge for events in which case it is vital that they make it clear.

The mission is to:

 * Facilitate wholesome community events and meetups
 * Never charge for anything
 * Never show ads
 * Have no commercial interests  
 * Not offer freemium gimmicks 
 * Not platform sleazy money making meetups

Organizers can let LocalMeet handle the attendees, or they can use other websites, are charge at the door, or anything else they like.
